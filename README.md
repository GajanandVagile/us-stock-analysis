# Stock Market Data Analysis & Prediction
 
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, and Predictive Analytics using real-time financial data from The Investors Exchange (IEX). Leveraging Python, I analyzed stock market trends, assessed stock volatility, and implemented predictive models including the Monte Carlo simulation to forecast future stock prices.

### ðŸš€ Project Highlights

Data Source: Real-time and historical stock data obtained via the IEX Developer API

### Objective:

Extract and clean stock market data

Visualize key financial trends and metrics

Evaluate risk based on historical data

Forecast stock prices using simulation methods

### ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Tool	Version
Python	3.6
Jupyter Notebook	5.6.0
NumPy	1.14.2
Pandas	0.23.4
pandas-datareader	0.6.0
Matplotlib	2.10.0
Seaborn	0.8.0

### ðŸ“Š Data Description

Data is retrieved using pandas-datareader from the IEX Finance API. The dataset includes:

Stock quotes (open, close, high, low)

Company fundamentals

Corporate actions

Market statistics

This data supports both real-time and historical financial analysis.

### ðŸ“ˆ Methods Used

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data distribution and trends

Data Visualization: Plotted price movements, returns, moving averages, etc.

Risk Analysis: Evaluated stock risk using historical volatility

Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulated thousands of future price paths to estimate risk and potential returns
